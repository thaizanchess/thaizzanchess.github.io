    Balls. You play with them. You bounce them around. You jump on em and you throw them around. We all love playing with balls. Balls have great uses in everyday life, even if you dont realize it. There is even math dedicated about balls. There is so many things you can do with balls. There are just infinite possibilities.

    We all know balls as something you can play with. You can bounce them, like a basketball. You can squeeze them, like a stress ball. You can kick them, like a soccer ball. And you can even sit on balls, like an exercise ball. There are over 17 sports that use balls. Thats just part of what balls can do. Balls are a great way to interact with your pets, and give them attention. If you so happen to have balls laying around in your house that are safe for pets, you and your pet dog can play with some balls for fun. If you have a friend over, you can both bring your balls so you can both play with each others balls. You can bring any ball you would like to play with your friends, because there are so many balls with lots of variety in the world. And im not done yet, because you can even eat balls. Some balls have nuts in them, like ferrero rocher, or the m&m peanut version. There are also different flavous of balls. Lindor is a great example because of the different chocolate ball flavours they have. If you arent a fan of sweets, then the meatier option is for you. Meatballs is a famous dish that is basically meat, but balls. Ikea is known for how swedish it is, and its swedish meatball just tops it off. The juciness, and the flavour just make it what it really is. Topping the swedish meatball off with creamy gravy just makes the swedish meatball unlike any other. And I wont forget about my italian friends, their meatballs are also just as superior, with their juciness and taste. And their meatballs are generally bigger than the swedish.

    Balls can get very serious, they even have put themselves on the math textbooks. In math terms, balls can be known as spheres. Balls are a geometric object that is thicker than a circle. Math about balls can be very complicated, so I wont get deeper into it. But what I can get deeper into is the universe. When you look up at the night sky, you might see stars. All those stars are big, massive, and thick balls. When these massive balls die, they eject a lot of stuff into space. This process is called a supernova. The bigger the ball, the more powerful the blast. So now that you know that you are surrounded by balls, if you really think hard enough you are standing on a big ball right now. Yes, even the earth is a ball. Everything is a ball. A planet is round because of gravity pulling things together. If you think the earth is flat, it simply isnt because that would break physics. Physics like balls. The things that make up us, who we are and everything around us is also made up of balls. The atom, the substance that makes up everything is made up of balls. These balls are called the electron, proton, and neutron. These 3 balls make up everything known to man, and without these 3 balls we wouldnt exist. The things you see, the reason you arent blind is because you have 2 balls on your face. Its the eyes. The eye allows you to see the world around you, and helps you do basically everything you need to do. This is how important balls are in our lives, and how it impacts us in different ways.

    Using balls as an exercise tool is a great way to be fit. Using exercise balls can help you stretch, lift weights, and do tons of more exercises. There are many different size of exercise balls to choose to help you if you are too short or too big. You can also squeeze balls using a stress ball. These balls are very squishy and they are very satisfying to squish. Its basically a fidget toy. There is also this weird toy that is a big heavy ball, that makes your ice cream. If you kick it around for a few minutes anywhere you get ice cream. The ingredients are simple and its generally used to make creamy, vanilla ice cream.

    Balls are everywhere. On your hand, the world around you, everything. You can play with balls, eat some balls, and satisfy yourself with balls. There is absolutely no limit. This speech is to make you think about balls more, because they affect your lives more than you think. This round shape isnt just in sports. Its you. Its food. Its your life. The next time you feel kinda lonely, on a hillside, just know that there is something thats always with you: Balls.
